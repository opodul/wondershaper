#Context: another covid-19 story...
At home I have a limited 4G connection (100GB/month). 
It is usually working pretty good. (download=20Mbps , upload=20Mbps).
So it is very easy to burn ! 12hours at full speed and then you have to wait for the next month... 

In addition, when working at home (Covid situation) It is just not possible to take a skype call when wife or kids are on netflix ! (the bandwidth should be enough but it is obviously not even distributed)

BTW, I discovered that netflix automatically adapt to the bandwidth, hight bandwidth = high resolution ... even if your small screen is not able to display it ! 
There is some setting possible on the account but the effect are very limited.
Also, when you stop to watch netflix on android device, it is still downloading in background !


My router is very basic and do not make possible to limit the bandwidth per user.
So I took a old raspberrypi and created an wifi access point (using hostapd and isc-dhcp-server) 
then comes wondershaper which is great to limit the bandwidth globally.
but i pushed further to limit the bandwidth per user.

I did not bother to make a configurable script. All is harcodded. So for information this is my setting :

- raspberrypi is connected to my internet routeur with eth0

- raspberrypi access point is on wlan0 <br>192.167.10.1 is the ip of the pi, and dhcp distribute address from 192.167.10.10 to 192.167.10.19<br>
192.167.10.10 = mine --> using class 1:10  <br>
192.167.10.11 = wife_device1 --> using class 1:20 <br>
192.167.10.12 = wife_device2 --> using class 1:20 <br>
192.167.10.13+ considered for not priority users. --> using class 1:30

filter are based on ip addr, it could probably be done based on MAC but I did not investigated further.

One important thing to understand is that which tc you can only control the speed of the packet you send (upload).
It is actually exactly that we want as the raspberrypi is sending to device data. So upload for raspberry is actually download for the wifi connected devices.


That being said, if you check the last lines of wondershaper, you will see the trick for download: incoming paquets are redirected to a virtual interface and then the outgoing speed of the virtual interface is limited. As a result when the fifo of the virtual channel is full, any additionnal incoming paquet will be lost and therefore the server/client will addapt and lower the speed... 
not very pretty but it works.

mywondershaper only limit wlan0 rasberry upload.

An alternative would be to use iptable with hashlimit module. It would have the benefit to tarquet only small paquet (SYNC-handskake), therefore it would be a little bit more efficient as no "big" paquet would be dropped.

About
--------------

Wonder Shaper is a script that allows the user to limit the bandwidth of one or more network adapters. It does so by using iproute's tc command, but greatly simplifies its operation. Wonder Shaper was first released by Bert Hubert in 2002, but the original version lacked a command-line interface, from on version 1.2 this feature was added. From version 1.3, the HTB queuing is used instead of CBQ, allowing better bandwidth management on high speed (above ten megabits) links. In version 1.4 an improved ingress shaping method was implemented and the ability to limit either down or up (both is still possible too). The original README is a rather lengthy document and is saved under README.old, for those who'd like some more background information. Except any notes on operation this document is considered up-to-date.

Installation
--------------

### Obtaining wondershaper

It is recommended to clone the GitHub repository of wondershaper such that you can pull in new updates at any time (if available). Open a new terminal and clone the repository using

    git clone https://github.com/magnific0/wondershaper.git

This will clone wondershaper in your current folder in a new folder named wondershaper. Now enter the folder using

    cd wondershaper

### Using wondershaper

You can run wondershaper (as any user with sufficient permissions) without installation and stop following the instructions at this point. Show the wondershaper usage instructions by typing

    ./wondershaper -h

The program details all available options on how to use wondershaper. Next is to pick an interface that you want to shape. You can see all available interfaces by typing

    ip addr show

Note that on older systems this command might not be available. In this case you should run ```ifconfig``` instead.

Identify the network interface that you want to shape. The names [differ per system](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/).

In the following example a wireless interface is limited to an [upload of 4Mbps and download of 8Mbps](http://whatsabyte.com/).

    ./wondershaper -a wlp4s0 -u 4096 -d 8192

If you get messages telling you that ```RTNETLINK answers: Operation not permitted``` your user account does not have sufficient privileges. In that case try:

    sudo ./wondershaper -a wlp4s0 -u 4096 -d 8192

### System installation (optional)

A makefile file provided for easy installation. The default location for wondershaper is in ```/usr/bin```. If you want to install to your system you can run:

    sudo make install

You can verify that wondershaper was installed correctly by entering:

    which wondershaper

This should return ```/usr/bin/wondershaper```. You can follow the same instructions as explained in the "Using wondershaper" section, but instead of running the local version of the program you now run the system version by removing the ```./``` from the beginning of each command. For example to show the help instructions again run:

    wondershaper -h

### Persistent usage of wondershaper (optional)


Instead of using the commandline options to set the rates and interface as previously shown, it is necessary to set these parameters in the ```wondershaper.conf``` configuration file. You can edit this file using your favourite text editor (vim in the example below) as such:

    sudo vim /etc/systemd/wondershaper.conf

To make sure wondershaper is reactivated on reboot a systemd service file is provided. First enable wondershaper as a systemd service using:

    sudo systemctl enable --now wondershaper.service

This way wondershaper is activated with your setting upon reboot.

Usage
--------------

        wondershaper [-hcs] [-a <adapter>] [-d <rate>] [-u <rate>]

The following command line options are allowed:

- `-h` Display help

- `-a <adapter>` Set the adapter

- `-d <rate>` Set maximum download rate (in Kbps) and/or

- `-u <rate>` Set maximum upload rate (in Kbps)

- `-p` Use the presets in /etc/systemd/wondershaper.conf

- `-c` Clear the limits from adapter

- `-s` Show the current status of adapter

The different modes are:

        wondershaper -a <adapter> -d <rate> -u <rate>
    
        wondershaper -c -a <adapter>
    
        wondershaper -s -a <adapter>

Some examples:

        wondershaper -a eth0 -d 1024 -u 512
    
        wondershaper -a eth1 -d 94000 -u 94000  # could be used on a 100Mbps link
    
        wondershaper -a eth1 -u 94000  # only limit upload
    
        wondershaper -c -a eth0
